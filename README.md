**Monte-Carlo Simulation:**<br>
There are many sophisticated models people can build for solving a forecasting problem. However, they frequently stick to simple models based on average historical values, intuition and some high level domain-specific heuristics. This approach may be precise enough for the problem at hand but there are alternatives that can add more information to the prediction with a reasonable amount of additional effort.<br>
One approach that can produce a better understanding of the range of potential outcomes and help avoid the “flaw of averages” is a Monte Carlo simulation. Let's see how we can use Monte Carlo simulation methods to predict the range of potential values for a sales compensation budget.<br>

**Problem Background**
We want to predict how much money we should budget for sales commissions for the next year.

We have a defined formula for calculating commissions and we likely have some experience with prior years’ commissions payments.

This problem is important from a business perspective. Sales commissions can be a large selling expense and it is important to plan appropriately for this expense.
